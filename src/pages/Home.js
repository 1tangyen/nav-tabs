          This sunny and spacious room is for those traveling light and looking
          for a comfy and cosy place to lay their head for a night or two. This
          beach house sits in a vibrant neighborhood littered with cafes, pubs,
          restaurants, and supermarkets and is close to all the major
          attractions such as Edinburgh Castle and Arthur's Seat.
